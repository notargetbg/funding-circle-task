### Funding Circle PingPong ScoreTable

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this interesting task. It was pleasure to work on this, mainly because I had freedom on what to use.


I've separated the tasks by increasing the complexity and size of the project.
<hr>

##### Task1
A simple solution with almost everything hardcoded inside the html besides one click handler.
##### Task2
Done using gulp and sass as requested. All the logic was done using native es5 js without any modern features.
Also, I have implemented additional logic in order to generate 'correct' score results and choose a winner.
##### Task3
Done using webpack, react.js and babel. The `<AutoCompleteInput />` component accepts *Array* of words and it's input should give us some suggestions.
You can choose from the following names based on the default app *State*:

`["John", "Sarah", "Amber", "Seth", "Jin", "Bren", "Cathrin", "Nick", "Elsa", "Margaret"]`

### Instructions on how to run Task3 locally:
Run `npm install` inside Task3 directory, then run `npm run start` in order to start webpack server OR `npm run build` in order to do a dev build.

Thank you! :)
